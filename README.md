# rpc_server
A simple RPC server in C.

# MAKEFILE:
Use command 'make rpc' for creating the executables frontend and backend. 

# Requirements:
Frontend and Backend Requirements: IP and port at startup for execution to function properly. The IP and port of the frontend and backend depend on their execution location. The backend can always used 127.0.0.1 (loopback IP) while the frontends, if executing on different machines, need to have the IP of the backend.
